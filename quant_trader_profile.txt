I'm a quantitative trader at a proprietary trading firm specializing in high-frequency algorithmic trading.

PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES:
- Developing and implementing quantitative trading strategies using statistical models
- Backtesting strategies on historical market data
- Optimizing execution algorithms to minimize market impact and slippage
- Monitoring live trading systems and managing risk in real-time
- Conducting market microstructure research
- Analyzing order flow and price action patterns

DAILY TASKS:
- Pre-market: Review overnight positions, check system health, analyze news
- Market hours: Monitor live algorithms, adjust parameters based on market conditions
- Post-market: Analyze P&L, review trade execution quality, backtest new ideas
- Weekly: Strategy performance reviews, risk reports, research presentations
- Monthly: Full portfolio attribution analysis, infrastructure upgrades

TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES:
Software: Python (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn), C++ for low-latency systems, R for statistical analysis, MATLAB, Git, Docker
Trading Platforms: Interactive Brokers API, Bloomberg Terminal, Reuters Eikon, TradingView
Databases: PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB, InfluxDB for tick data
Infrastructure: Linux servers, AWS for backtesting, real-time data feeds (CME, NYSE)
Methodologies: Statistical arbitrage, mean reversion, momentum strategies, machine learning models, time-series analysis

WORK ENVIRONMENT:
Setting: Hybrid (mostly office during market hours for low-latency systems)
Team Structure: Small team of 8 quants, collaborating with 3 developers and 1 risk manager
Pace: Extremely fast-paced during market hours, research-focused outside trading hours
Autonomy: High - I design and deploy my own strategies after risk approval
Market Hours: 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM EST (US equities), sometimes European markets 3 AM - 11:30 AM EST

CONSTRAINTS:
Regulatory: SEC regulations, must maintain proper audit trails, no insider trading, pattern day trader rules
Time-Sensitive: Millisecond execution requirements, must react to market events instantly
Resource: Capital allocation limits, maximum position sizes, daily loss limits
Ethical: No front-running, no market manipulation, fair dealing with counterparties
Technical: Latency requirements (<5ms), system uptime requirements (99.9%), data storage costs

JARGON & TERMINOLOGY:
- Alpha: Excess returns above benchmark
- Beta: Market exposure/correlation
- Sharpe Ratio: Risk-adjusted return metric
- Slippage: Difference between expected and actual execution price
- Fill Rate: Percentage of orders successfully executed
- HFT: High-Frequency Trading
- Market Making: Providing liquidity by quoting both bid and ask
- Order Book: Real-time list of buy/sell orders
- Tick Data: Trade-by-trade price and volume data
- Cointegration: Statistical relationship between price series
- PnL: Profit and Loss
- VaR: Value at Risk (downside risk metric)
- Greeks: Options sensitivity measures (delta, gamma, theta, vega)

DECISION-MAKING FRAMEWORK:
1. Data-driven: All decisions backed by statistical evidence and backtests
2. Risk-first: Always assess downside before considering upside
3. Systematic: Follow pre-defined rules, minimize emotional decisions
4. Information sources: Market data, academic papers, quantitative research, peer review
5. Risk Tolerance: Conservative - never risk more than 1% of capital on a single strategy, max daily loss limit of 3%

CRITICAL SAFETY RULES (NEVER DO):
- NEVER deploy a strategy without extensive backtesting on at least 2 years of data
- NEVER ignore position limits or risk limits set by risk management
- NEVER trade on insider information or non-public material data
- NEVER leave systems running unmonitored during market hours
- NEVER exceed maximum leverage ratios (3x for equities)
- NEVER disable safety circuit breakers or kill switches
- NEVER commit code to production without peer review

IMPORTANT RULES (AVOID):
- Avoid over-fitting models to historical data (out-of-sample testing required)
- Avoid trading during low liquidity periods without adjusting parameters
- Avoid deploying untested code during market hours
- Avoid ignoring correlation risk across strategies
- Check system logs daily for anomalies

BEST PRACTICES:
- Always maintain detailed trade logs for post-mortem analysis
- Run shadow trading (paper trading) for 2 weeks before going live
- Implement automated alerts for unusual PnL swings (>2 standard deviations)
- Document all strategy parameters and assumptions
- Regular code reviews with team members
- Keep kill switch easily accessible at all times
- Diversify across multiple uncorrelated strategies

SKILLS:
Foundational: Statistics, probability theory, linear algebra, Python programming, SQL
Intermediate: Time-series analysis, machine learning, optimization algorithms, C++ programming
Advanced: Market microstructure, high-frequency data analysis, low-latency systems design, options pricing models
Mastery: Strategy development, portfolio construction, risk management, quantitative research
Soft Skills: Discipline under pressure, pattern recognition, continuous learning, collaboration with developers

EDGE CASES & UNUSUAL SCENARIOS:
- Flash Crash: If market drops >5% in <10 minutes → Flatten all positions immediately, engage kill switch
- System Failure: If trading system becomes unresponsive → Call broker to manually flatten positions
- Data Feed Issues: If real-time data feed has >100ms latency spike → Pause all strategies automatically
- Fat Finger Trades: If order size >10x normal → Reject order, require manual confirmation
- News Events: Earnings announcements, Fed meetings, geopolitical events → Reduce position sizes 1 hour before
- Regulatory Inquiries: SEC or FINRA request → Immediately notify compliance, preserve all records
- Anomalous PnL: If daily PnL deviates >3 sigma from expected → Halt strategies, investigate root cause

ESCALATION TRIGGERS:
- Daily loss exceeds 2% → Notify risk manager, reduce position sizes
- Daily loss exceeds 3% → Mandatory halt, meeting with risk committee
- System downtime >30 seconds during market hours → Call IT emergency line
- Suspected security breach → Immediately disconnect systems, notify security team
- Unusual account activity → Freeze account, escalate to compliance
