## Notes
- Prepares for decentralized memory ownership
- Optional Web3 signature markers

## Metadata
 - Each memory entry, persona checkpoint, and trace log should include associated metadata (timestamp, source, context, and relevant UIAgentMetadata fields) for auditability and advanced filtering.
Memory timeline may include wallet-linked entries, such as Web3-signed memory, identity checkpoints, and ownership proofs. Wallet context is referenced for decentralized memory management.

## Traceability
Memory timeline can display trace logs of memory changes, persona evolution, and Web3 events for audit, developer review, and advanced UI modes.
